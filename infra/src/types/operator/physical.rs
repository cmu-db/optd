//! Type representations of physical operators in (materialized) query plans.

/// A type representing a physical operator in an output physical query execution plan.
///
/// Each variant of `PhysicalOperator` represents a specific kind of logical operator. The current
/// supported operators are `TableScan`, `PhysicalFilter`, and `HashJoin`.
///
/// This type is generic over a `Link` type, which specifies what kind of children this operator is
/// allowed to have in whatever kind of plan it is contained in. This makes it possible to reuse the
/// `PhysicalOperator` type in differnt kinds of trees.
///
/// For example, `PhysicalOperator` _**is**_ a valid operator in [`PhysicalPlan`] and
/// [`PartialPhysicalPlan`], _**but it is not a valid operator in**_ [`LogicalPlan`] nor
/// [`PartialLogicalPlan`].
