# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What features would this add? What is the expected outcome?

# Impacted components

Which components (e.g. core, memo table, representation, rule engine, etc.) will need to be changed
or will be affected by this feature?

# Proposed implementation

This section should focus on how this feature should be implemented, and the design decisions that
need to be made in order to make the feature work.

Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

Include subsections on:

- Enginering effort: How hard will it be to implement this feature?
- Reliability: What failure modes and corner cases would this feature introduce?
- Scalability: How scalable is this feature?

# Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this?

# Rational and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.

A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other optimizers and what experience did the people implementing that
  feature have?
- Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers
  to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

# Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature
  before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would
affect the project as a whole in a holistic way.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but
otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot
think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to
accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale
in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information.
