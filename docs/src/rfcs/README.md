# RFCs

This section contains RFCs for features and technical concepts proposed to be integrated into the system. In some cases, they could be retroactive and document why certain design decisions were made. Writing RFCs enables us to early validate our concepts and keep peers informed around the design of codebase. Since it is not our goal to keep these documents up to date, please refer to the Architecture section if you are looking for the most up-to-date description of the system. However, with context, these RFCs should still provide useful insights into the reasoning and thought process behind certain design decisions.

To write a new RFC, copy `docs/rfcs/0000-templated.md` to a new file and start editing the header and all the other sections. 

For your RFC PR, you should also make sure to edit [SUMMARY.md](../SUMMARY.md) to make it visible in the mdBook docs. Make sure your RFC numbering does not collides with the ones other people wrote and have not been merged yet.
